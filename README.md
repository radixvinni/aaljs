Empythoned
==========

Empythoned is a build script that uses [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten)
to compile CPython for use in a browser. It attempts to compile the main
interpreter as a single small executable for running with nodejs.

The project has not been updated for 2 years, so i created my own script. 
The project is in its infancy. Right now the core interpreter works very well,
but libraries either don't work at all or contain various bugs.

Aaljs
===========

This project aims to compile a binding of MPEI AAL library for use in javascript.
Using the whole standart library is not an aim.
